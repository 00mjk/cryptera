The moderator of the match will conduct the toss. The winner of the toss gets the chance to ban the first map and the other team gets the next chance to ban another map. This will go on until one map is left, which will automatically be the map being played. The loser of the toss gets to choose either defending or attacking. Rules Players are expected to use a single account for each player. Each team must consist of 5 players and 2 substitute players.( 5 Players are mandatory. Substitutes are optional.) Substitutes can be included only at the beginning of a new match. The moderator has to be informed about the substitutes included. Players must be available at least 15 minutes in the lobby before the match is scheduled to begin. Failure of the entire team to show up on time will lead to forfeiture of the match. The team captain needs to add all their members and the coordinator (whose details will be subsequently revealed) as their friends with their RIOT IDs. The captains will be responsible for adding their team players into the game lobby. Add your teammates in your friend-list well ahead of the match. Cheating in any form (including exploiting bugs) will not be tolerated and will lead to the disqualifying of the entire team from the event. Team captains must send a screenshot of the final scorecard to the coordinator at the end of the match, for future reference. Only the base (vanilla) version of the game is to be used (i.e., no mods of any sort).",
      "In case of any changes in the schedule of matches, team captains will be informed. The coordinator will let the team leader know regarding match fixtures, tournament schedules and other updates regarding further stages of the tournamen",
      "If the team fails to show up, the opponents automatically get a walk ove",
